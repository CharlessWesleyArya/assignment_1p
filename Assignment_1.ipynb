    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "1.)* is an MULTIPLICATION OPERATOR\n",
    "\n",
    "   'hello' is a STRING VALUE.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   -87.8 is a FLOATING POINT VALUE.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - is a SUBTRACTION OPERATOR.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   / is a DIVISION OPERATOR.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   + is a ADDITION OPERATOR.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   6 is a INTEGER VALUE.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2.)\n",
    "\n",
    "String: String is a value in which we can give one or more characters at a time .\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable: Variable is used to store values of any types. it is refernce to a value which is stored in some memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) 3 different data types are \n",
    "\n",
    "    int) int is a data type is used to  store integer type values whether it is positive or negative.\n",
    "    ex: 2,45,134567.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    float) float is a data type is used to store Floating type values.\n",
    "    ex: 12.6, 99.4.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Complex Numbers) this type is used to store complex values.\n",
    "    ex: 4+7j.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Expression is made up of combination of variables ,operators and values.\n",
    "    Expression do a particular operations and gives some result at the end.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ex: x=1+3;\n",
    "        here we are giving an assignment and addition operators, adding of 1+3 ,and the result will be stored in x, so after the complition of this statement some result is given by the expression .\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "5.) Expression is made up of combination of variables ,operators and values where as statement will just an instruction given.\n",
    "\n",
    "in this spam =10 will assign the value of 10 into spam variable and will not do any operation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.) bacon still remains as 22 because after initialization we are just adding 1 and is going to show the reslut , but the addition is not storing in any variable even in bacon .so bacon contains 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7.) the values of the given two statements will be same. way of operation is different but the reslut will remain same  because the number of multiplication and addition are same.\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam'+'spamspam' ='spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam'*3= 'spamspamspam'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8.)In python we can give alpha-numberic character and underscores as a variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "but we cannot start a variable name with numbers ,this is the reason for 100 cant be a valid variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9.)There are three Pre-defined functions by which we can change one value to our required type like integer,floating and string , they are\n",
    "\n",
    "int() --> is used to change another data type value to integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "float()--> is used to change another data type values to floating value.\n",
    "\n",
    "str()--> is used to change another data type values to string type values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10.) 'I have eaten' +99+'burritos.'\n",
    "    \n",
    " this expression will result error ,becaues we cannot concatinate string and integer values , we can only concate string with a strig, and we can add some numerical values to int not string values so this is getting error.\n",
    " \n",
    " we can fix this by removing 99 which is integer and can give a string in that place '99' or 'ninety nine' .\n",
